"""Page geometry and pagination (build step 5).

Geometry: the measure (line length) is about 30 times the type size (Bringhurst: "usually
around 30 times the size of the type", 20 to 40 within the expectable range), kept between 45
and 80 characters of the body font as measured (his copyfitting table in effect: characters
per line from the font's widths). The margins take the rest of the width, the inside never
smaller than the outside (binding takes some of it), and a share of the height (bottom larger
than top), with floors of 0.5 in and KDP's gutter minimum for the page count. The text height
is a whole number of body lines.

Pagination: display pages (title page...) and front matter in one roman section from i, with
display pages counted but carrying no folio; the first chapter (or part) starts arabic 1.
Title page, front matter, parts and the first chapter open on a recto; later chapters on a
recto or the next page, as the profile says. Blank versos get the E-Blank master.
